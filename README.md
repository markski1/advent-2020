My solutions for Advent of Code 2020 #AdventOfCode

Nothing to point out. I'm doing them in C. I'm trying to solve the problems without using libraries that aren't strictly necesary.

Criticism is VERY welcome!

EDIT: I have abandoned this because I am currently very busy. I'll probably finish the rest on late december/january!

EDIT 2: No, I won't
